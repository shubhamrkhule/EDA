Before we analyze the data using machine learning techniques, we must understand the dataset we are dealing with.
We may or may not have the domain knowledge for every dataset, however, Exploratory Data Analysis techniques can be used to uncover important charecteristics of the data, including but not limited to: 

1) Characteristics of individual attributes
2) Correlations between multiple attributes
3) Viewing target values again reduced dimensions / against specific dimensions, etc.
4) Extract important attributes
5) Find anamolies / outliers, if any

EDA helps us maximize our insight into the data we are analyzing.
As a part of graphical EDA, we plot raw data as well as derived statistical metrics.
With experience, one can derive deeper insights from the data

We can say that by performing EDA, we postpone the algorithm selection and model fitting, till the point we get a better understanding of the data itself to make a choice of the same.
